# 📚 Dad Laghari Rural Education Portal (Offline-First)

> **Providing knowledge where the internet cannot reach."**

# 🌟 Project Overview
This project is a lightweight **offline-first educational platform** designed specifically for the students of **Dad Laghari** a rural town in Sindh, Pakistan.

In my community, reliable internet access is scarce and many orphans and students cannot access modern educational resources. I developed this portal to run locally on low-end devices without requiring an internet connection, providing immediate access to:
- **Mathematics** (Basic Arithmetic)
- **English** (Grammar & Vocabulary)
- **Cyber Safety** (Digital Hygiene & Security)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5:** Semantic structure for accessibility.
- **CSS3:** Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop.
- **JavaScript (ES6):** Interactive quizzes and dynamic lesson content.
- **No External Libraries:** Zero dependencies to ensure it runs on any old computer without installation.

## 🎯 Key Features
1.  **Offline Capability:** Runs entirely from a local folder or USB stick.
2.  **Interactive Quizzes:** Instant feedback for students to test their learning.
3.  **Lightweight:** The entire application is under 1MB, making it easy to share via Bluetooth or USB.
4.  **Community Focused:** Content is tailored to the specific needs of rural beginners.

## 🤝 Purpose & Motivation
The main purpose of this project is to help and support the poor students in my country and community those can't afford quality education and to further my studies in Computer Science. This project represents my commitment to using technology for **social good** (Khidmah). My goal is to return to Pakistan and scale this system to serve thousands of off grid schools across the region.

## 📄 License
This project is open-source and free to use for any educational purpose.
